<h1 align="center" id="title">Cobalt</h1>

* <p>Developers often face challenges in understanding large codebases, which can be time-consuming and cumbersome. Our solution addresses this by leveraging artificial intelligence to streamline the process. Simply paste the GitHub link of the repository you want to understand, and our tool will provide an overview of the project and display all its files. You can then select any file to receive detailed explanations of its functions, making it easier to grasp complex codebases.
</p>

* <p>Additionally, developers frequently need to reuse code snippets across different projects. To support this, we've created a secure snippet storage system. Our machine learning algorithm allows you to search for specific code snippets using titles, descriptions, and tags, ensuring you can quickly find and reuse the code you need, enhancing productivity and efficiency.</p>
